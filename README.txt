We implemented the RESET TABLES script within our webapp. To reset tables, simply go to home.php and click reset. If it is the first time using the app, 
there will be some errors that it can't delete tables, but it will still load the new tables. Click reset once again, and then you're ready to go!

You can find the required SQL setup script in src/PROJECT-SQL-SETUP.sql, but running it from the webapp does the same thing!
